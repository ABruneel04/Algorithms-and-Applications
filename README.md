Homework 1:
Given a MazeProblem object, which specifies the actions and transitions available in the search, returns a solution to the problem as a sequence of actions that leads from the initial to a goal state. Gives the most efficient solution to solving a given maze.

Homework 2:
Makes the most optimal choices to win in the game Tic-Tac-Total (Tic-Tac-Toe with addition). Given a game state, makes the optimal choice from that state as defined by the mechanics of the game of Tic-Tac-Total.

Homework 3:
Constructs a new SpellEx spelling corrector from a given "dictionary" of words mapped to their frequencies found in some corpus (with the higher counts being the more prevalent, and thus, the more likely to be suggested).

Homework 4:
Huffman instances provide reusable Huffman Encoding Maps for compressing and decompressing text corpi with comparable distributions of characters.

Homework 5:
CSP: Calendar Satisfaction Problem Solver. Provides a solution for scheduling some n meetings in a given period of time and according to some set of unary and binary constraints on the dates of each meeting.
